# -make_enything_invisible
In this code we create own ‘Invisibility Cloak’ using simple computer vision techniques in OpenCV.It
turns out that you can create this magical experience using an image processing technique called color detection and segmentation.

## The basic idea is given below:

<ul>
<li>1.Capture and store the background frame.</li>
<li>2.Detect the red colored cloth using color detection algorithm.</li>
<li>3.Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask.</li>
<li>4.Generate the final augmented output to create the magical effect.</li>
</ul>
